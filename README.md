## Description
This project is designed to help anyone looking to create a one-stop-shop for all of their employee's profiles. With the help of this app, users can input from their terminal the names, emails, id's, and more of their employees. Users can even specify what role each employee has in the company as well. After answering questions to provide information about the employees, an html page will be generated with cards for each of the employees displaying all of their information that was inputted.

## Usage
In order to use this program, clone the code from the repo and make sure to install node and inquirer v8.2.4. Open the integrated terminal in the index.js file and run 'node index.js'. Questions will begin to appear in the terminal and, after providing information, the code will generate an html page with all of that inputted information.
